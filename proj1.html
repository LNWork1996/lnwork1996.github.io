										<h2>Brief Description</h2>
									</header>
									<p>In order to better myself and refine my web programming skills, I decided to create this website. It started off rather small and boring, but it soon grew into much more. The purpose of this project was to display my skills in an easy-to-read format and to allow people to get to know me in a much more interactive way.</p>

												<h3>Coding</h3>
											</header>
											<p>When I began developing this website, my HTML5, JS and CSS skills were pretty mediocre. However, my goal was clear - to produce something that I was proud of.</p>

												<h3>It takes Time & Effort.</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I started off with a simple goal. I wanted to create a website to allow people to obtain a sense of who I am. But.. How would I do that? I'd like for the website to feature who I am, what I've accomplished, and my future goals. With this in mind, I began working.</p>

												<h3>Everything You See.</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I personalized everything you see. From the font size, to the images displayed, even the floating banner that follows you along while you scroll. Each and every paragraph, links, and descriptions all took lines of code. I really wanted the feel of a professional website and the satisfaction of programming and editing it myself.</p>

										<h2>Summation</h2>
									</header>
									<p>This project means a lot to me. It was a deep dive into web programming and developing a website with a sense of personality. I was able to use my skills in HTML5, CSS and JS to really create something that I was proud of. This project took time, probably more time than I care to admit, and I don't think I'll ever consider it "Complete". As I grow and accomplish more, I will continually keep this website updated. I'm proud I was able to take a blank index.html canvas and create something that I consider to be beautiful and in depth. Thanks for taking a look.</p>
